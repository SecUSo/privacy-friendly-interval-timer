Privacy Friendly Interval Timer supports the user during his/her circuit training session and helps him achieve his/her training goals. In order to support the user during his training, the app provides stopwatches, which can be configured according to the user’s own training and resting phases. In addition, the app reminds the user of previously defined training sessions via a notification. To check the user’s goals and to recognize training progress, the app offers the possibility to retrieve statistics about the training times and the calories burned in a daily, weekly or monthly overview. 

This App requires minimal permissions and is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group
developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische Universität Darmstadt.
